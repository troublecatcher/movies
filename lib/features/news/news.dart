          '‘Happy Gilmore 2’ Script in the Works From Adam Sandler, Says Original Film Star',
      content: '''
Happy Gilmore star Christopher McDonald hopes that the Adam Sandler-led sports comedy is driving toward a follow-up.

McDonald, who played villain Shooter McGavin in director Dennis Dugan’s 1996 Universal movie, said during an appearance Friday on Audacy radio show 92.3 The Fan that Sandler recently showed him a draft of the script for a Happy Gilmore sequel.

“I saw Adam about two weeks ago, and he says, ‘McDonald, you’re gonna love this,'” McDonald recalls. “He shows me the first draft of Happy Gilmore 2.” The actor continued, “He did show me that, and I thought, ‘Wow, that would be awesome.’ So it’s in the works. Fans, demand it, damn it!”

      content: '''
Will Jeffrey Jones appear in Tim Burton‘s hugely anticipated Beetlejuice sequel, Beetlejuice Beetlejuice?

That’s the question on the mind of eagle-eyed fans of the upcoming Warner Bros. film’s trailer, who noticed a glimpse of the actor on a headstone in a funeral scene. But a rep for Jones confirms to The Hollywood Reporter that the actor does not appear in Beetlejuice Beetlejuice.

The funeral is attended by Catherine O’Hara (playing Delia Deetz, second wife of Jones’ Charles Deetz in the original film), Winona Ryder (Lydia Deetz, Charles’ daughter with his first, deceased wife) and Jenna Ortega (a newcomer to the franchise, who plays Astrid Deetz, Lydia’s teenage daughter).

      title: 'Sundance Institute CEO Joana Vicente Stepping Down',
      content: '''
Joana Vicente is departing the Sundance Institute, where she has overseen the nonprofit and its storied film festival since late 2021. Sundance board member Amanda Kelso will step in as acting CEO through April, while Vicente will remain as an adviser to Kelso and the board through June.

Vicente came to Sundance from the Toronto International Film Festival, and arrived as COVID had pushed the festival online for 2021 and again in 2022. During her tenure, she spearheaded a hybrid format for 2023 and 2024, in which films would be viewed in person as well as online. Like most festivals, fundraising has been challenging due to the pandemic followed by pressures in the larger economy. In June, the Institute laid off 11 staffers. Vicente has also been under pressure to set the festival up for the long term and shape its vision amid a challenging landscape for independent film.

Kevin Bacon is going to prom.

The actor made the surprise announcement on Friday’s Today show that he will attend this year’s prom at the school where Footloose was filmed. This year’s celebration will be the last at the building, as the school will be relocating at the end of the academic year.

Footloose, which celebrates the 40th anniversary of its release this year, was filmed at a school in Payson, Utah. The students have actively tried to get Bacon to attend the prom by using the hashtag #bacontopayson on social media, re-creating scenes from the film, learning the Footloose dance and hosting an event on prom day to benefit Bacon’s SixDegrees.org foundation. Their efforts caught the actor’s attention.

Let the ghost hunting begin.

Sony’s spring event pic Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire has started off its North American box office run with \$4.7 million in Thursday previews before rolling out everywhere on Friday.

His son, Jason Reitman, directed Afterlife, but this time turned over helming duties to series co-scribe Gil Kenan.

Jack Black is totally down for a School of Rock sequel.

More than two decades after the beloved musical comedy, directed by Richard Linklater, premiered in 2003, the actor-comedian recently told JOE that he’s “ready” to reprise his role as energetic musician Dewey Finn.
